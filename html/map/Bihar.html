	<h3>Bihar is a state in East India. It is the 13th largest state in India. 
	The third largest state of India by population, it is also contiguous with Uttar Pradesh to its west, Nepal to the north, the northern part of West Bengal to the east, with Jharkhand to the south. 
	The Bihar plain is split by the river Ganges which flows from west to east. 
	In ancient and classical India, Bihar was considered a centre of power, learning, and culture. 
	From Magadha arose India’s first empire, the Maurya empire, as well as one of the world’s most widely adhered-to religions, Buddhism. 
	Since the late 1970s, Bihar has lagged far behind other Indian states in terms of social and economic development because of Govt.’s ignorance towards Bihar.
